# peaks(data) - Returns the indices of peaks. A peak has a lower number on both the left and the right.
# valleys(data) - Returns the indices of 'valleys'. A valley is a number with a higher number on both the left and the right.
# peaks_and_valleys(data) - uses the above two functions to compile a single list of the peaks and valleys in order of appearance in the original data.

# data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 6, 5, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 8, 7, 6, 7, 8, 9]
